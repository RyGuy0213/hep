# About this Project

This is a demo project intended to be a code sample. The project is small in scope, but it encompasses a number of useful pieces that should offer a glimpse into my experience and capabilities as a developer. Additonally, it covers a topic that is very near and dear to my heart, and I think it's always useful to learn more about a developer than just what he does at a keyboard!

  

## Deployed Site

The site is deployed with Vercel. It can be viewed [here](https://hep.vercel.app/).

  

## Component Library

This project embraces Component-Driven Development (CDD). A library of reusable components developed for this site is viewable [here](https://ryguy0213.github.io/hep/storybook). The component library is built with Storybook.

  

## Useful Notes

The most notable piece of this project is the score calculator found on [this page](https://hep.vercel.app/heptathlon-scoring). The code for the UI component is found [here](https://github.com/RyGuy0213/hep/blob/main/components/03-organisms/HeptathlonScore/HeptathlonScore.tsx).  The math that forms the foundation of the utility of this calculator  is developed under a functional paradigm, and the useful files can be found in [this directory](https://github.com/RyGuy0213/hep/tree/main/utils/hepcalc).
